## Intro
For our final project at Makers Academy we chose to build a game-playing bot.
The choice of project was motivated primarily by the technical challenge involved, as well as a shared interest among members of the group in artificial intelligence and machine learning topics.


## Quickstart



## Setup
Given our goals for the project (pushing ourselves technically, and learning about machine learning and artificial intelligence, our choice of implementation was governed by two central considerations:
  1. Providing an appropriately challenging project to both consolidate and stretch the knowledge and skills acquired during the Makers Academy course. In particular, to ensure that the project involves writing a good deal of code (as opposed to simply connecting existing technologies and libraries).
  2. Finding a suitable way to assess the performance of our project as a bot, rather than code that merely passes tests.

As such, we have chosen to tackle [X PUZZLE] from [Riddles.io](https://www.riddles.io/). This website provides puzzles that satisfy all of our requirements: the games are sufficiently challenging, the website is popular meaning there are lots of other bots to benchmark against, and the website provides some starter bots, allowing us to take inspiration for our code from bots written in other languages. We chose the [X PUZZLE] because...

## Challenges



## Tech Stack
The technologies used for this project are as follows:
- Language(s): Ruby
  - We took the decision to use Ruby both to use a language we were comfortable with, given the type of challenge we were attempting, and to allow us to really push ourselves to the limit in a given language
- API (to connect with relevant competition &c) ...
- Testing frameworks ...
