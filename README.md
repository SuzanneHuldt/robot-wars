## Makers Academy final project

For our final project at Makers Academy we have chosen to build a game-playing bot.
The choice of project was motivated primarily by the technical challenge involved, as well
as a shared interest among members of the group in artificial intelligence and machine learning topics.

## Set Up
- Choices as to implementation are governed by two central considerations:
1. Providing an appropriately challenging project to both consolidate and stretch the knowledge and skills
acquired during the Makers Academy course. In particular, we wish to ensure that the completion of the project
involves writing a good deal of code (as opposed to solely learning how best to connect existing technologies or libraries).
2. Finding a suitable way to assess the performance of our project as a bot, rather than code that merely passes tests.

- As such, we have chosen to .... (whatever competition we choose or don't choose &c)


## Tech Stack
- In order to fulfill the requirements set for ourselves above, the technologies used are as follows:
- Language(s) ...
- API (to connect with relevant competition &c) ...
- Testing frameworks ...
